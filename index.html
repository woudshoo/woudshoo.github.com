<h1>Index of Projects</h1>

Here will be an index to my different projects

<h2>Common Lisp Projects</h2>

<h3>Graph Related</h3>

This project is my take on graph reductions.  The projects are mainly inspired by my desire to make
sense of reivision graphs gone mad.  The projects try to give a different
view on the revision graph by trying to distill a smaller graph still retaining all
the key features of the original graph.  Or make a smaller graph by zooming
in on a small subset of revisions.   

<dl>
<dt><a href="wo-graph/index.html">WO Graph documentation</a></dt>
<dd>
This contains the basic infrastructure, representing a graph. 
It is just infrastructure and defines an interface for the algorithms on top.
By implementing this interface you can define your own graph datastructure 
for usage by the algorithms in the next project.

<dt><a href="wo-graph-functions/index.html">WO Graph functions documentation</a></dt>
<dd>
This project contains graph algorithms. The graphs should implement the interface
defined in the project above.

<dt><a href="cl-git/index.html">CL Git, libgit2 bindings documentation</a></dt>
<dd>
This project is forked/collaborated from Russell Sim's cl-git project.  
It provides bindings to manipulate git repositories.
